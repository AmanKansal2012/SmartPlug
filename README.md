# SmartPlug
Plugin with ease

We aim to create hassle-free, hands-free automation for electronic devices that operates on our fingertip in a shoestring budget.
The smart plug is a simple way to automate the wired devices in your home. So that you can control your appliances from any point around the world and besides this, you can do much more.
Our business model will initially provide services to customers who are differently-abled and physically challenged and then we will try to expand it to other customers including people who need automation, including schools, universities, dance, and music centers and hospitals.
Since a large population lives in rural and semi urban localities with proper access to electricity, we believe it has a big market base and hence it's economically viable and feasible for business.
